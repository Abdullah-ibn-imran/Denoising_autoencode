MNIST Image Denoising using a Stacked Autoencoder
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating a stacked autoencoder for denoising MNIST images. An autoencoder learns efficient data encodings. This stacked autoencoder uses dense layers to reconstruct clean images from noisy inputs.

Project Overview
The goal is to remove noise from images using a stacked autoencoder. This network learns to reconstruct clean images from noisy versions.

Dataset
The project uses the MNIST dataset: 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.

Model Architecture
The stacked autoencoder has an encoder to reduce image dimensionality and a decoder to reconstruct the image. It's trained with noisy images as input and clean images as output.

Notebook Contents
The notebook covers:

Loading and Preprocessing Data: Loading and normalizing MNIST data.
Adding Noise: Creating noisy versions of the images.
Building the Autoencoder: Defining the model with Keras.
Training the Autoencoder: Training the model on noisy data.
Evaluating Denoising Performance: Visualizing results.
